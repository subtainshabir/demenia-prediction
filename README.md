# Introduction to Dementia Disease Prediction

Dementia is a broad category of brain diseases that cause a long-term and often gradual decrease in the ability to think and remember, significantly affecting a person's daily functioning. Among the various types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease is the most common, accounting for approximately 60-80% of cases. Other types include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.

## Methodology
* Load Dataset (link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f1BXGz2o82I0B5ENyK89MD5HOwE0S9js/view?usp=drive_link)
* Preprocessing
* EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
* Feature Engineering
* Model Building

I have implemented 5 model on the dataset and at the end I have compared the performance of all the models.
